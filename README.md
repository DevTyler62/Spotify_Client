These are the client files for the Datafy project. In order to view the server files you will need to locate the other respoitory named Spotify_authorization.
This project was built in a team environment in a one college semester period. My contrubition was doing all of the coding as well as putting the application on the internet 
for others either in our class or for the world to view. 

This was my first time using React JS and so I was learning as I went along. I know that their is quite a lot of things that I could improve upon to follow some of the best 
practices when writing out the program. As I learn more at some point I would like to come back to this project and be able to see if I can recreate it in a better way. 

## Project Details

This project allows a user to access their personal Spotify account to see some of their listening history visualized. They will be able to see thier top tracks and artists they listen to. They will also be able to see all of thier playlists they have created and then be able to view each on and see the average of the stastics from each song in a graphical form. These details come from Spotify's API in which each song has a set of specifications such as energy, liveness, and dancability. They will also be able to view a individual songs details in the now playing section in a pie graph form. In this secton as well they can use it as a player to which they can skip to the next song, go back to the previous one, as well as pausing and playing the song again.

Srvices Used
  - Spotify's API
  - Chart JS
  - Heroku

To put on the web I used Heroku's services. If the site does not have people visiting it very often then it will take a while to load up. In this case sometimes after it takign a while to laod it will show an error and if that is the case then you shoudl just need to reload the page and it should work.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
